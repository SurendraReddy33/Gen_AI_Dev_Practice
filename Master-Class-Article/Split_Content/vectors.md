## üìê Distance Metrics (Vector Similarity)
 
To compare vectors, we use distance or similarity metrics:
 
| Metric               | Use Case                          | Range             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| Cosine Similarity     | Semantic similarity               | -1 to 1           |
| Euclidean Distance    | Geometric distance (straight line)| 0 to ‚àû            |
| Manhattan Distance    | Sum of absolute differences       | 0 to ‚àû            |
| Dot Product           | Used in attention mechanisms      | -‚àû to ‚àû           |
 
**Note**: Higher cosine similarity means more semantically similar.
